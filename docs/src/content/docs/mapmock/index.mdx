**Map Mock** is the first-class feature of EchoProxy. It is designed with love, very easy to learn and use.
It helps you to map & mock HTTP(s) request/response elegantly.

> **Entrance**: Click **left sidebar** button <MaterialSymbolsMapOutline style={inlineIcon} />  

:::note
Please make sure **Enable Map Mock** is checked ✅

## Map Rule
The first step is creating a new **Map Rule** by clicking the **+Add** button. There are two Map **Rule Types**:
> **Map Local**: Map HTTP(s) request to a local file, where the response Header & Body will be parsed from.  
> **Map Remote**: Map HTTP(s) request to a new URL, where the response Header & Body will be fetched from.

<Image src={mapRuleImage} style="border-radius:6px; max-width: 35rem;" alt="Map Rule" />

**Method**:
> **GET/POST...**: Rule matches when request method is exactly the same.  
> **ANY**: Rule matches for any request method.

**Match Type**
> **Equals**: Rule matches when request URL is exactly the same.  
> **Wildcard**: Rule matches when request URL **Wildcard** matched.  
> **Regex**: Rule matches when request URL **Regex** matched.

:::note
**Wildcard**: Only supports **\***    
**Regex**: It uses [Golang Regex Syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax)
:::

## Map Local
Map HTTP(s) request to a local file, where the response Header & Body will be parsed from.
It won't send HTTP(s) request to the original URL.

Let's take an example to learn Map Local. Example URL https://demo.echolabx.com/. It's default response:  
> **Content-Type**: text/plain; charset=utf-8  
> **Content Body**:
```
Hi: EchoProxy
```

Create a Map Rule with following settings:
> **MapLocal**, GET, Equals, Enabled ✅  
> URL: https://demo.echolabx.com/

Set the content of **Response(Header+Body)** as following:
```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

{
  "msg": "success"
}
```

:::note
**Response(Header+Body)** file format:
* the first part is **Header**: the first line is HTTP proto and statusCode, and the following lines are Header key/value pairs.
* following with an empty new line as the **seperator** between Header and Body
* the second part is **Body**: it can be any text as you expected

Visit the URL https://demo.echolabx.com/ **again with refresh**. You'll see the response has been changed by Map Mock.
New response is:
> **Content-Type**: application/json; charset=UTF-8  
> **Content Body**:
```json
{
  "msg": "success"
}
```

:::note
**Prerequisite**: Please make sure **demo.echolabx.com** has been **[Unlocked by Domain](/device/macos#unlock-https)**
:::

## Map Remote
Map HTTP(s) request to a new URL, where the response Header & Body will be fetched from.
It will send HTTP(s) requests to the new URL when set.

Let’s take an example. We want to map URL-1 to URL-2:
> **URL-1**: https://demo.echolabx.com/json  
> **URL-2**: https://demo.echolabx.com/json-v2

Create a Map Rule with following settings:
> **MapRemote**, GET, Equals, Enabled ✅  
> URL: https://demo.echolabx.com/json

Set **EchoScript** with the following content:
```go
on_request := func(env, req) {
  return {
    url: "https://demo.echolabx.com/json-v2"
  }
}
```

<Image src={mapRemoteImage1} style="border-radius:3px;" alt="Map Local" />

Visit the URL https://demo.echolabx.com/json **again with refresh**. You'll see the response is the exactly same with URL-2.

:::note
Let's refine this example to make it more flexible and adaptable to various situations.
We want to use one rule to handle all these senarios:  
**Rule1**:  
https://demo.echolabx.com/json?page=1 → https://demo.echolabx.com/json-v2?page=1  
**Rule2**:  
https://demo.echolabx.com/json?age=30 → https://demo.echolabx.com/json-v2?age=30
:::

Update the Map Rule with following settings:
> **MapRemote**, GET, **Wildcard**, Enabled ✅  
> URL: https://demo.echolabx.com/json*

Set **EchoScript** with the following content:
```go
on_request := func(env, req) {
  return {
    url: "https://demo.echolabx.com/json-v2" + req.u[1]
  }
}
```

:::note
Match type is set to **Wildcard**, and add **\*** at the end of Rule URL.  
In EchoScript, **req.u[1]** gets the first matched substring of **Wildcard \***.
When multiple **\*** in Rule URL, the matched substrings are in **req.u[1]**, **req.u[2]**, **req.u[3]**, etc.  
**req.u** is an array holds Wildcard match results. **req.u[0]** is the original full URL.
:::

<Image src={mapRemoteImage2} style="border-radius:3px;" alt="Map Local" />

Visit the following URLs **again with refresh**.  
You'll see responses are changed to URL **json-v2**.
* https://demo.echolabx.com/json
* https://demo.echolabx.com/json?page=1
* https://demo.echolabx.com/json?age=30
